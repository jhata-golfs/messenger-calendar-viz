# messenger-calendar-viz

This project was meant to explore the data set exported from the FB download data function and to test out the visual capabilities of the ggplot_calendar_heatmap. 

From the FB data set, I utilize the FB messenger data to visualize the frequency of messages per day in a calendar format. 

The .R script in this repo is meant to be a "plug & play" script where you need only to replace the reference to your own .json file to visualize your owwn data.
